.TH PSA2MSA 1 "June 1999" "pftools 2.2"
.SH NAME
psa2msa \-  reformat PSA file to Pearson/Fasta multiple sequence alignment file 
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B psa2msa 
[ -dlpu ] [ [ psa-file | - ] ]   [ M=#]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B psa2msa
reformats a PSA-formatted profile-sequence alignment file into a
Pearson/Fasta-formatted multiple sequence alignment file.
The result is written to the standard output. 
.I psa-file
contains alignments of several sequence segments to the same profile 
in PSA format. 
Such a file is typically generated by program 
.B pfsearch  
using option
.I -x.
The output can be converted into other formats (
.I e.g. 
MSF) with the aid of the public domain
program
.B readseq
(available from ftp.bio.indiana.edu:/molbio/readseq). 
.B psa2msa
can be used as a filter if - is used instead of the input
filename, or if the input filename is omitted. 
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
\-d
Replace periods by dashes on output.
.TP
\-l
Replace upper case letters by lower case letters on output.
.TP
\-p
Replace dashes by periods on output.
.TP
\-u
Replace lower case letters by upper case letters on output.
.SH PARAMETERS
.TP
M=#
Maximal length of an insertion.
If the real length of an insertion exceeds this value, the excess number 
of residues will be deleted from the center 
of the insertion. 
.I M=0
means no upper limit for the length of an insertion.
Setting an insertion length limit helps to keep the resulting alignment
at manageable size. 
Default: M=0.

.B pfsearch
-bx ecp.prf CVPBR322 | 
.B psa2msa
-du |
.B readseq
-p -fMSF > ecp.msf

Generates a multiple sequence alignment of predicted
.I E. coli
promoters on both strands of plasmid pBR322.
ecp.prf contains a profile for 
.I E. coli
promoters.  
CVPBR322 contains EMBL entry J01749|CVPBR322.
The result in
.I ecp.msf
can further be processed by GCG programs accepting MSF files as input.

.B pfsearch.
