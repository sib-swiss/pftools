.SH NAME
GtoP \- convert a profile in GCG format into PROSITE format  

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B GtoP 

.SH DESCRIPTION
.B GtoP
converts a profile generated by the GCG program 
.B ProfileMake\c
\&,
or by a GCG-compatible profile construction program,
into the new format used in PROSITE, and optionally
rescales the profile. 
The input parameters are elicited interactively; 
the result is written to the standard output.
During the interactive dialog, the program asks for an input file
name, for a gap (opening) weight, for a gap length (extension) 
weight, for a rescaling factor, and whether or not symmetric gap
treatment should be applied.
.PP
On input, 
.B GtoP
divides all weights of the profile by 100, as GCG programs do.
On output, profile scores are multiplied by the rescaling factor
and rounded to the nearest integer. 
If symmetric gap treatment is applied, the gap opening weights are divided 
by 2 and assigned to the corresponding MI, MD, IM, and DM transition scores.
If symmetric gap treatment is disabled, gap opening weights are assigned
to the corresponding MI and MD the transition scores as they are;
the IM and DM transition scores are set to zero.

.SH EXAMPLES
.TP
(1)
.B GtoP
> outfile 
.nf
.in +3n

Input file ? sh3.gpr 
Gap weight (default=1.0) ?
Gap length weight (default=1.0) ?
Rescaling factor (default=100) ? 10
Symmetric gap weighting (Yes/No, default=Y) ? No 
.in -3n

.fi
Converts the GCG-formatted profile in sh3.gpr 
into PROSITE format and saves the output in outfile.
The resulting profile is equivalent
(though not text-wise identical) to the  
profile in sh3.prf (see man pages of 
.B pfsearch\c
\&), except for accessories (cut-off values, normalization modes, etc.).  

.SH BUGS
.B GtoP
defines 
.I SCORE=0 
for the mandatory cut-off level zero. This parameter should be changed to 
a more reasonable value prior to profile search operations.
