.SH NAME
pfw \- weight sequences of a multiple sequence alignment
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B pfw
[ msf-file | - ] [N=#] [X=#] [R=#] [W=#]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B pfw 
computes new weights for individual sequences in a multiple sequence alignment
using the method of Sibbald and Argos (1990).
The file containing the multiple sequence alignment (msf-file) must be
in MSF format as generated by GCG programs or by readseq (checksums are ignored).
If `-' is specified instead
of a real filename, the multiple sequence alignment is read 
from the standard input.  
.B pfw
writes a new msf-file with modified weights to the standard output.
.SH PARAMETERS
.TP
N=#
Number of shuffles per sequence to be performed. Note that
an average relative precision of \fIr\fP percent is achieved by approximately
(100/\fIr\fP)-squared shuffles. Default: N=100 (10% precision). 
.TP
X=#
Gap excision threshold. This is the minimal fraction of non-gap characters
a column of the multiple sequence alignment must contain 
in order to be considered for weighting. Default: X=0.5. 
.TP
R=#
Seed for the random number generator. This must be an negative integer
(zero or positive integers will be reset to negative integers). Default=-123456789. 
.TP
W=#
Total weight. The initially computed weights will be multiplied by a constant
factor such that the sum of all weights equals this value. 
Default: W=1.
