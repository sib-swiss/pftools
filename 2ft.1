.SH NAME
2ft \- 2-frame translation of a DNA sequence into protein 
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B 2ft
[ -rs ] < seq-library-file
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B 2ft
converts both strands of one or several DNA sequences into so-called
"interleaved frame-translated" DNA sequences. 
An "interleaved frame-translated" DNA sequence is an amino acid sequence of translated
overlapping codons. For instance, the DNA sequence 
"ATGGCA" consisting of four overlapping codons would be translated into the amino acid sequence
"MWGA". 
Stop codons are represented by character "O".
.I seq-library-file
contains one or several sequences in Pearson/Fasta format.

This program is used for searching genomic or EST sequence database
with frame-search profiles generated by pftools program
.B ptof.

.SH OPTIONS
