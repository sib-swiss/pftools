.TH GTOP 1 "February 1998" "pftools 2.1"
.SH NAME
gtop \- convert a profile in GCG format into PROSITE format  

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B gtop
[ -as ] [ gcg-profile ]   [G=#] [E=#] [F=#] [O=#] 
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B gtop
converts a profile generated by the GCG program 
.B ProfileMake\c
\&,
or by a GCG-compatible profile construction program,
into PROSITE format, and optionally
rescales the profile. 
The result is written to the standard output. 
On input, 
.B gtop
divides all weights of the profile by 100, as GCG programs do.
On output, profile scores are multiplied by the rescaling factor
.I F
and rounded to the nearest integer. 
If symmetric gap weighting mode is chosen, the gap opening weights 
are divided 
by 2 and assigned to the MI, MD, IM, and DM transition scores.
If asymmetric gap weighting mode is chosen, the gap opening weights
are left unchanged and assigned to the MI and MD transition scores only.
If no argument is specified, the program attempts to read the GCG-formatted
profile from the standard input.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
\-a
Apply asymmetric gap weighting mode.
.TP
\-s
Apply symmetric gap weighting mode (default).
.SH PARAMETERS
.TP
G=#
Gap opening penalty. Default: G=4.5.
.TP
E=#
Gap extension penalty. Default: E=0.05. 
.TP
F=#
Rescaling factor. Default: F=100.
.TP
O=#
Output score offset. This value is added to all profile match scores
after multiplication by the rescaling factor
.I F.
Default: O=0.
.SH EXAMPLES

(1)
.B gtop
sh3.gpr G=1.0 E=1.0 F=50 | 
.B pfsearch
-far - sh3.seq | 
.B sort
-nr
 
First converts the GCG-formatted profile in sh3.gpr into PROSITE format,
then searches the protein library sh3.seq with the reformatted profile 
to generate a sorted list of optimal alignment scores.
The option
.I -r
causes alignment scores to be expressed in raw score units. 
sh3.seq contains 20 SH3 domain-containing protein sequences from SWISS-PROT
release 32.

.I See
also manual pages of
.B pfsearch
and UNIX command
.B sort.
.SH BUGS
.B gtop
defines 
.I "SCORE=0; N_SCORE=0;" 
for the mandatory cut-off level zero. These parameters should be changed 
to more reasonable values using a text editor, prior to profile search
operations.
