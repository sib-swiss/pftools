"pftools" is a collection of experimental programs supporting the
new profile format and search method of PROSITE and NUCSITE.

Version 1.0 contains FORTRAN 77 source code and manual pages for
the following programs:

   pfsearch
   pfscan
   psa2msa
   gtop  

These programs have succssfully been compiled and tested under
SunOS, Solaris, OSF1, IRIX, HP-UX operating systems.

For compilation under HP_UX and IRIX, the Makefile needs to be
modified according to instructions given therein.  

For use under HP-UX, the file sterr.f should also be modified
according to instructions given therein. 

In order to compile the programs, type:

   make

This will create the four binaries listed above. You may now move these
binaries as well as the corresponding manual pages in:
 
   pfsearch.1
   pfscan.1
   psa2msa.1
   gtop.1  

to more appropriate directories.  
 
Further included in this release are seven demo data files:

   CVPBR322 
   GTPA_HUMAN
   ecp.prf
   prosite13.prf
   sh3.gpr
   sh3.prf
   sh3.seq

a test script: 

   test.csh 

and a test ouput file. 

   test.out

To test the programs, type: 

   ( csh test.csh ) > out 
   diff test.out out
