"pftools" is a collection of experimental programs supporting the
new profile format and search method of PROSITE and NUCSITE.

Version 0.1 contains FORTRAN 77 source code for two main programs:

   pfsearch
   GtoP  

These programs compile successfully under SunOS and OSF/1 (and
perhaps other UNIX operation systems).  

In order to compile them, type:

   make 

Man pages are available in: 

   GtoP.1
   pfsearch.1.
 
Further included in this directory are the following sample
input files:

   sh3.prf
   sh3.gpr
   PBR322
